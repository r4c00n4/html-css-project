            <h2>Raccoons:</h2>
            <p>Bandit-masked raccoons are a familiar sight just about everywhere, because they will eat just about anything. 
                These ubiquitous mammals are found in forests, marshes, prairies, and even in cities. 
                They are adaptable and use their dexterous front paws and long fingers to find and feast on a wide variety of fare.</p>

            <h2>Red Fox:</h2>
            <p>he Red fox is the most widely distributed and populous canid in the world, having colonised large parts of Europe, America, Asia and Africa. 
                In the British Isles, where there are no longer any other native wild canids, it is referred to simply as ‘the fox’. 
                The Red Fox pre-breeding season population is estimated to be 258,000.</p>

            <h2> Cats:</h2>
            <p>Felis catus has had a very long relationship with humans. Ancient Egyptians may have first domesticated cats as early as 4,000 years ago. Plentiful rodents probably drew wild felines to human communities. 
                The cats' skill in killing them may have first earned the affectionate attention of humans. 
                Early Egyptians worshipped a cat goddess and even mummified their beloved pets for their journey to the next world—accompanied by mummified mice! Cultures around the world later adopted cats as their own companions.</p>
